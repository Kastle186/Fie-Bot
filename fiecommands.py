# These are the helper functions for the non-game fie-commands (e.g. 'fie time').   #
# Try to name them after the commands they represent, if said commands are short    #
# enough. Like for 'fie time', the function's name would be fie_time(). Just to     #
# make it easier to navigate the code for debugging, extending, etc.                #
#                                                                                   #
# The exception to this rule is 'fie_response()', as that one handles Fie's replies #
# when someone says specific phrases in the server, rather than there being a       #
# command named 'fie response'.                                                     #
